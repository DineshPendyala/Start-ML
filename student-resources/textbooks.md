Here are some useful (and free!) textbooks to supplement your studies:

Stats/Probability:
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (a great first step into Stats, can also be taken as part of [free online course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about))
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) (for the more advanced)
- [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) (a great refresher, somewhat condensed)

Linear Algebra:
- [Linear Algebra and Its Applications](http://www.math.hcmus.edu.vn/~bxthang/Linear%20algebra%20and%20its%20applications.pdf) (Highly-regarded intro to Lin. Alg., can also be taken as part of [free online course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/))

Python:
- [Learning Python](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Y-n6IlHYliSXZxMk0xT0NSY1E/preview) (The best introduction to Python I know of. Yes it's long, but nobody said this would be easy)
- [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/) (another free refresher)

Data Analysis:
- [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.columbia.edu/~dano/courses/4739/lectures/3/Python4DataAnalysis.pdf) (Nice, beginner introduction to Python's data analysis libraries)

Machine Learning:
- [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/thinkcomplexity.pdf) (Crucial content to know before becoming a professional programmer)

As always, feel free to ask your instructor for additional (or more specific) suggestions!
