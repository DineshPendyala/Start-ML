Naive Bayes is a very popular classifier because it has minimal storage requirements, is fast, can be tuned easily with more data, and has found very useful applications in text classificaton. For example, Paul Graham originally proposed using Naive Bayes to detect spam in his [Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).\n",

    "Let's pretend we have an email with three words: \"Send money now.\" We'll use Naive Bayes to classify it as **ham or spam.** (\"Ham\" just means not spam. It can include emails that look like spam but that you opt into!)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(spam \\ | \\ \\text{send money now}) = \\frac {P(\\text{send money now} \\ | \\ spam) \\times P(spam)} {P(\\text{send money now})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By assuming that the features (the words) are conditionally independent, we can simplify the likelihood function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(spam \\ | \\ \\text{send money now}) \\approx \\frac {P(\\text{send} \\ | \\ spam) \\times P(\\text{money} \\ | \\ spam) \\times P(\\text{now} \\ | \\ spam) \\times P(spam)} {P(\\text{send money now})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each conditional probability in the numerator is easily calculated directly from the training data!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can calculate all of the values in the numerator by examining a corpus of spam email:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(spam \\ | \\ \\text{send money now}) \\approx \\frac {0.2 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.9} {P(\\text{send money now})} = \\frac {0.0018} {P(\\text{send money now})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We would repeat this process with a corpus of ham email:\n",

    "$$P(ham \\ | \\ \\text{send money now}) \\approx \\frac {0.05 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.1 \\times 0.1} {P(\\text{send money now})} = \\frac {0.000005} {P(\\text{send money now})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All we care about is whether spam or ham has the higher probability, and so we predict that the email is spam."

    "- The \"naive\" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.\n",
    "- The normalization constant (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and prediction are very fast.\n",
    "- It's somewhat interpretable.\n",
    "- No tuning is required.\n",
    "- Features don't need scaling.\n",
    "- It's insensitive to irrelevant features (with enough observations).\n",
    "- It performs better than logistic regression when the training set is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \"spam\" is dependent on non-independent combinations of individual words, it may not work well.\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well calibrated.\n",
    "- Correlated features can be problematic (due to the independence assumption).\n",
    "- It can't handle negative features (with Multinomial Naive Bayes).\n",
    "- It has a higher \"asymptotic error\" than logistic regression.\n",
