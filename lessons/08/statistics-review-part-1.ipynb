    "\n",
    "Linear models are efficient and well understood. They can often closely approximate nonlinear solutions, and they scale to high dimensions without difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these desirable properties, linear algebra is a need-to-know subject for machine learning. In fact, it forms the basis of foundational models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and principal component analysis (PCA). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, advanced models such as neural networks and support vector machines rely on linear algebra as their \"trick\" for impressive speedups. Modern-day GPUs are essentially linear algebra supercomputers. And, to utilize their power on a GPU, models must often be carefully formulated in terms of vectors and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than that, today's advanced models build upon the simpler foundational models. Each neuron in a neural net is essentially a logistic regressor! Support vector machines utilize a kernel trick to craftily make problems linear that would not otherwise appear to be.\n",
