You might train on the entire dataset as the very last step when a model is chosen, hoping to make the final model as accurate as possible. Or, you could use this to estimate the degree of overfitting.\n",

You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",
    "3. **Cross-validation** is the gold standard for estimating accuracy and comparing accuracy across models.\n",
