## Learning Objectives

- **Identify** the types of problems a neural network is likely to succeed at.
- **Explain** the similarities/differences between real and artificial neurons.
- **Define** the working components of a basic, feed-forward neural network.
- **Determine** how to apply neural networks to the prediction problem of your choosing.

## Student Requirements

**Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to**:
- Perform basic linear algebra, including dot products and matrix multiplications.
- Perform simple logistic regression in Pandas (or by hand in Numpy using fitted coefficient values).
- Understand basic logic gates, and their function.
