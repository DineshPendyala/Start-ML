## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part 1: Python Data Types
 
- Discuss Python as a programming language.
- Define integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string operations.
- Demonstrate variable assignment. 

### Part 2: Python Iteration, Control Flows, and Functions
 
- Define `Python` control flow and conditional programming.
- Implement `for` and `while` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `if, else` conditional statements.
- Create functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Demonstrate error handling using `try, except` statements.
- Use `Python` control flow and functions to help us parse, clean, edit and analyze data sets.

## Lesson Outline

<!--- > Instructor Note: This material may be challenging to get through if students are new to programming. Expect students to struggle with for loops and functions — you likely will have to do these exercises as a code-along. If time is left over, there is practice on the Coffee Preferences data set. If not, students can use it for more practice at home. --->
